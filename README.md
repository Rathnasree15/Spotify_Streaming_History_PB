# Spotify_Streaming_History_PB
This project analyzes a decade of Spotify listening data using Power BI to create interactive dashboards visualizing key listening trends. The data reveals top artists, songs, albums, listening platforms, and listening patterns over time. 
**Introduction**
This Power BI project provides a comprehensive analysis of music listening habits over a decade, leveraging data from Spotify. The dashboard offers insights into top artists, tracks, albums, and listening patterns, showcasing how music preferences have evolved over the decade.  The goal of this project is to visualize and analyze personal music consumption trends, providing a detailed overview of listening behavior, favorite artists, and platforms used.
While Spotify Wrapped offers a yearly snapshot of listening habits, this Power BI project extends that analysis over a decade (2013 - 2024), providing a richer and more nuanced understanding of your musical journey. The interactive nature of the dashboard allows you to explore trends across different time periods and platforms, offering insights unavailable in the standard yearly summaries. This analysis is particularly useful for music enthusiasts, data analysts, and anyone interested in understanding their music consumption patterns. The insights derived from this dashboard can help users reflect on their music preferences, discover trends, and even make informed decisions about future listening habits.
